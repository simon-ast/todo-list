# ToDo - List
A very simple "application" that allows the generation of a ToDo / Reminder 
list. The list can be interactively customised and displays the following
information: 

`Comment -> Due Date -> Remaining Time`

The entries are colour coded by urgency (white -> yellow -> red). The bash 
script `execute.sh` enables the continuous display of the ToDo list and can
be included in the autostart cycle.
